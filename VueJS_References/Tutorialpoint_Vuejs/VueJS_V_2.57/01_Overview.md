VueJS is an open source progressive JavaScript framework used to develop interactive web interfaces. It is one of the famous frameworks used to simplify web development. VueJS focusses on the view layer. It can be easily integrated into big projects for front-end development without any issues.

The installation for VueJS is very easy to start with. Any developer can easily understand and build interactive web interfaces in a matter of time. VueJS is created by Evan You, an ex-employee from Google. The first version of VueJS was released in Feb 2014. It recently has clocked to 64,828 stars on GitHub, making it very popular.

Features
Following are the features available with VueJS.

Virtual DOM
VueJS makes the use of virtual DOM, which is also used by other frameworks such as React, Ember, etc. The changes are not made to the DOM, instead a replica of the DOM is created which is present in the form of JavaScript data structures. Whenever any changes are to be made, they are made to the JavaScript data structures and the latter is compared with the original data structure. The final changes are then updated to the real DOM, which the user will see changing. This is good in terms of optimization, it is less expensive and the changes can be made at a faster rate.

Data Binding
The data binding feature helps manipulate or assign values to HTML attributes, change the style, assign classes with the help of binding directive called v-bind available with VueJS.

Components
Components are one of the important features of VueJS that helps create custom elements, which can be reused in HTML.

Event Handling
v-on is the attribute added to the DOM elements to listen to the events in VueJS.

Animation/Transition
VueJS provides various ways to apply transition to HTML elements when they are added/updated or removed from the DOM. VueJS has a built-in transition component that needs to be wrapped around the element for transition effect. We can easily add third party animation libraries and also add more interactivity to the interface.

Computed Properties
This is one of the important features of VueJS. It helps to listen to the changes made to the UI elements and performs the necessary calculations. There is no need of additional coding for this.

Templates
VueJS provides HTML-based templates that bind the DOM with the Vue instance data. Vue compiles the templates into virtual DOM Render functions. We can make use of the template of the render functions and to do so we have to replace the template with the render function.

Directives
VueJS has built-in directives such as v-if, v-else, v-show, v-on, v-bind, and v-model, which are used to perform various actions on the frontend.

Watchers
Watchers are applied to data that changes. For example, form input elements. Here, we donâ€™t have to add any additional events. Watcher takes care of handling any data changes making the code simple and fast.

Routing
Navigation between pages is performed with the help of vue-router.

Lightweight
VueJS script is very lightweight and the performance is also very fast.

Vue-CLI
VueJS can be installed at the command line using the vue-cli command line interface. It helps to build and compile the project easily using vue-cli.

Comparison with Other Frameworks
Now let us compare VueJS with other frameworks such as React, Angular, Ember, Knockout, and Polymer.

VueJS v/s React
Virtual DOM

Virtual DOM is a virtual representation of the DOM tree. With virtual DOM, a JavaScript object is created which is the same as the real DOM. Any time a change needs to be made to the DOM, a new JavaScript object is created and the changes are made. Later, both the JavaScript objects are compared and the final changes are updated in the real DOM.

VueJS and React both use virtual DOM, which makes it faster.

Template v/s JSX

VueJS uses html, js and css separately. It is very easy for a beginner to understand and adopt the VueJS style. The template based approach for VueJS is very easy.

React uses jsx approach. Everything is JavaScript for ReactJS. HTML and CSS are all part of JavaScript.

Installation Tools

React uses create react app and VueJS uses vue-cli /CDN/npm. Both are very easy to use and the project is set up with all the basic requirements. React needs webpack for the build, whereas VueJS does not. We can start with VueJS coding anywhere in jsfiddle or codepen using the cdn library.

Popularity

React is popular than VueJS. The job opportunity with React is more than VueJS. There is a big name behind React i.e. Facebook which makes it more popular. Since, React uses the core concept of JavaScript, it uses the best practice of JavaScript. One who works with React will definitely be a very good with all the JavaScript concepts.

VueJS is a developing framework. Presently, the job opportunities with VueJS are less in comparison to React. According to a survey, many people are adapting to VueJS, which can make it more popular in comparison to React and Angular. There is a good community working on the different features of VueJS. The vue-router is maintained by this community with regular updates.

VueJS has taken the good parts from Angular and React and has built a powerful library. VueJS is much faster in comparison to React/Angular because of its lightweight library.

VueJS v/s Angular
Similarities

VueJS has a lot of similarities with Angular. Directives such as v-if, v-for are almost similar to ngIf, ngFor of Angular. They both have a command line interface for project installation and to build it. VueJS uses Vue-cli and Angular uses angular-cli. Both offer two-way data binding, server side rendering, etc.

Complexity

Vuejs is very easy to learn and start with. As discussed earlier, a beginner can take the CDN library of VueJS and get started in codepen and jsfiddle.

For Angular, we need to go through a series of steps for installation and it is little difficult for beginners to get started with Angular. It uses TypeScript for coding which is difficult for people coming from core JavaScript background. However, it is easier to learn for users belonging to Java and C# background.

Performance

To decide the performance, it is up to the users. VueJS file size is much lighter than Angular. A comparison of the framework performance is provided in the following link http://stefankrause.net/js-frameworks-benchmark4/webdriver-ts/table.html

Popularity

At present, Angular is more popular than VueJS. A lot of organizations use Angular, making it very popular. Job opportunities are also more for candidates experienced in Angular. However, VueJS is taking up the place in the market and can be considered as a good competitor for Angular and React.

Dependencies

Angular provides a lot of built-in features. We have to import the required modules and get started with it, for example, @angular/animations, @angular/form.

VueJS does not have all the built-in features as Angular and needs to depend on third party libraries to work on it.

Flexibility

VueJS can be easily merged with any other big project without any issues. Angular will not be that easy to start working with any other existing project.

Backward Compatibility

We had AngularJS, Angular2 and now Angular4. AngularJS and Angular2 have vast difference. Project application developed in AngularJS cannot be converted to Angular2 because of the core differences.

The recent version of VueJS is 2.0 and it is good with backward compatibility. It provides good documentation, which is very easy to understand.

Typescript

Angular uses TypeScript for its coding. Users need to have knowledge of Typescript to get started with Angular. However, we can start with VueJS coding anywhere in jsfiddle or codepen using the cdn library. We can work with standard JavaScript, which is very easy to start with.

VueJS v/s Ember
Similarities

Ember provides Ember command line tool, i.e. ember-cli for easy installation and compiling for Ember projects.

VueJS has also a command line tool vue-cli to start and build projects.

They both have features such as router, template, and components which makes them very rich as the UI framework.

Performance

VueJS has better performance in comparison to Ember. Ember has added a glimmer rendering engine with the aim of improving the re-render performance, which is a similar concept as VueJS and React using virtual DOM. However, VueJS has a better performance when compared to Ember.

VueJS v/s Knockout
Knockout provides a good browser support. It is supported on the lower version of the IE whereas VueJS is not supported on IE8 and below. Knockout development has slowed down over time. There is not much popularity for the same in recent times.

On the other hand, VueJS has started gaining popularity with the Vue team providing regular updates.

VueJS v/s Polymer
Polymer library has been developed by Google. It is used in many Google projects such as Google I/O, Google Earth, Google Play Music, etc. It offers data binding and computed properties similar to VueJS.

Polymer custom element definition comprises plain JavaScript/CSS, element properties, lifecycle callbacks, and JavaScript methods. In comparison, VueJS allows to easily use JavaScript/html and CSS.

Polymer uses web component features and requires polyfills for browsers, which does not support these features. VueJS does not have such dependencies and works fine in all browsers from IE9+.
